## Training a tool to test

AIs can help you test!

I have trained generative adversarial networks to help help me do some of my testing work more swiftly, with greater coverage and fewer errors 

In this track talk, you’ll see how I set up a training environment for testing-focussed AIs using cloud servers, open-source software, and readily available datasets. I’ll demonstrate my trained AIs as they help me to 
* create tests and testing data that gets into the corners, 
* identify potentially-interesting changes in code and configuration,
* report problems more easily and more clearly. 

I’ll also describe my false starts and dead ends, and give example of ways that my AIs misled me. I’ll conclude by outlining what makes a testing task well-suited to this approach, and show you my vision of the future of testing with this next generation of tools.

Get ready to start training up your own hunting dogs of testing.
